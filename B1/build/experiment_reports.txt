Macro File: run1.mac
[cite_start]Particle: Proton (inferred from "Hadronic Processes for proton" sections) [cite: 115]
[cite_start]Energy: 1 GeV [cite: 126, 127]
[cite_start]Number of Events: 10,000 [cite: 139]
[cite_start]Threads Used: 12 Worker Threads (G4WT0 to G4WT11) [cite: 125, 126]

[RESULTS]
[cite_start]Total Energy Deposited: 3.61322 TeV (5.78902e-07 joule) [cite: 139]
[cite_start]Scoring Volume Mass: 8300.87 kg [cite: 139]
[cite_start]Absorbed Dose: 69.7398 picoGy [cite: 139]
[cite_start]RMS (Error Margin): 1.12352 picoGy [cite: 139]

[EXECUTION METRICS]
- The run was split across multiple worker threads (G4WT0 - G4WT11).
- [cite_start]Example Thread Performance (G4WT6): Processed 924 events, calculated 6.47 picoGy. [cite: 126]
- [cite_start]Example Thread Performance (G4WT4): Processed 1008 events, calculated 6.73 picoGy. [cite: 134]

[OBSERVATIONS]
- Successful execution in Multi-threaded mode.
- Dataset validation successful (G4PARTICLEXS and G4EMLOW loaded correctly).
- [cite_start]Hadronic processes (Elastic, Inelastic, etc.) were active for protons. [cite: 115, 116]
- [cite_start]EM Physics parameters: Min kinetic energy 100 eV, Max 100 TeV. [cite: 14]

[CONFIGURATION]
Simulation Framework: Geant4-11-03 [MT]
Physics List: FTFP_BERT
Macro File: run_gamma.mac (Copied from run1.mac)
Particle: Gamma (Photon)
Energy: 1 GeV
Number of Events: 10,000

[RESULTS]
Absorbed Dose: 150.668 picoGy
RMS (Error Margin): 0.285318 picoGy
Comparison with B1-001 (Proton): ~2.16x Higher Dose

[OBSERVATIONS]
- Gamma rays deposited significantly more energy in the scoring volume compared to protons at the same energy (1 GeV).
- Likely caused by electromagnetic showers (Pair Production) depositing energy locally, whereas high-energy protons might be punching through the target with lower Linear Energy Transfer (LET).
